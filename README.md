## Research Projects
**Understanding Moss Communities in Temperate Forest Ecosystems***

*Spring 2024*

Abstract:
Despite their abundance, only in the past few decades have mosses been recognized as important, dynamic components of northern plant communities. Mosses are integral components of forest ecosystems as they contribute to the overall biodiversity, provide crucial ecosystem functions, and can act as an indicator of a forest’s health. To help understand these communities and their response to disturbance I sampled moss diversity along nine transects at three sites of varying disturbance level in a forest recently impacted by a large-scale wind disturbance. I found that diversity was variable across disturbance levels, and more closely related to habitat availability than disturbance status. This work helps us to better understand regeneration and forest recovery after disturbance events.

## Symposiums
